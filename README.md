Fioulmarket: React.js technical test
==

For the need of our business, we have to build multiple forms that has to be configurable.

What we want you to do, is to do some refactoring on some code we wrote for you. And then, build the component that have some specifications that you will discover in the insructions part.

To fulfill this test, we want clean and not repetitive code. Feel free to use any library. Don't forget to be dry and solid.
Unit tests aren't mandatory, but they clearly are a bonus... ;)

Installation :
--
All you have to do is to install the vendors:
```
npm install
```

Run the project :
--
You will only have to run it in dev mode.
```
npm run start
```
The open your browser on `http://localhost:8080`

Once you've done that, you're up & ready for the test !

Project structure :
--
For simplicity and efficiency, we're based on `create-react-app`.

`config` contains all the necessary configuration file for the project.

`src` contains all the application code, that's the place you will mainly be. Hope you'll like it as we do !

`public` contains all the public files, you won't have to touch it.
